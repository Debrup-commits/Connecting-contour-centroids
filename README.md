# Connecting-contour-centroids

This task aims to identify the coordinates of centroids of the given shapes in the base image and connect them with straight lines.
This is achieved by following these steps:
1.Identifying countours via thresholding 
2.making a function that identifies the x and y coordinates of the centroid
3.drawing lines through the identified coordinates.
